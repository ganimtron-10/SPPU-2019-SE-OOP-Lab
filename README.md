| Question No. | Problem Statement | Code Link | Youtube Link |
|---|---|---|---|
|  | Group A |  |  |
| 1 | Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement<br><br>the following<br><br>1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).<br><br>2. Overloaded operator+ to add two complex numbers.<br><br>3. Overloaded operator* to multiply two complex numbers.4. Overloaded << and >> to<br><br>print and read Complex Numbers. | [Group-A/Q1.cpp](Group-A/Q1.cpp) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-IunMimiKg&list=PLlShVH4JA0otmMld-dvDBGxqqSNy1zlf3&index=2&pp=iAQB |
| 2 | Write a C++ program create a calculator for an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /). The program should take two operands from user and performs the operation on those two operands depending upon the operator entered by user. Use a switch statement to select the operation. Finally, display the result. |  |  |
| 3 | Develop an object oriented program in C++ to create a database of student information system containing the following information: Name, Roll number, Class, division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact address, telephone number, driving license no. and other.Construct the database with suitable member functions for initializing and destroying the data viz constructor, default constructor, Copy constructor, destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete. |  |  |
| 4 | Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio cassette versions. Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of a publication. From this class derive two classes: book, which adds a page count (type int), and tape, which adds a playing time in minutes (type float).Write a program that instantiates the book and tape classes, allows user to enter data and displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values. | [Group-B/Q4.cpp](Group-B/Q4.cpp) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9RyZ7ykjXk&list=PLlShVH4JA0otmMld-dvDBGxqqSNy1zlf3&index=3&pp=iAQB |
| 5 | A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies book details and requests for the number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed; otherwise the message Required copies not in stock is displayed. Design a system using a class called books with suitable member functions and Constructors. Use new operator in constructors to allocate memory space required. Implement C++ program for the system. | [Group-B/Q5.cpp](Group-B/Q5.cpp) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVa--kTwZOA&list=PLlShVH4JA0otmMld-dvDBGxqqSNy1zlf3&index=4&pp=iAQB |
| 6 | Create employee bio-data using following classes<br><br>i) Personal record<br><br>ii))Professional record<br><br>iii)Academic record Assume appropriate data members and member function to accept<br><br>required data & print bio-data. Create bio-data using multiple inheritance using C++. |  |  |
|  | Group B |  |  |
| 7 | Crete User defined exception to check the following conditions and throw the exception if the criterion does not meet.<br><br>a. User has age between 18 and 55<br><br>b. User stays has income between Rs. 50,000 â€“ Rs. 1,00,000 per month<br><br>c. User stays in Pune/ Mumbai/ Bangalore / Chennai<br><br>d. User has 4-wheeler<br><br>Accept age, Income, City, Vehicle from the user and check for the conditions mentioned above. If any of the condition not met then throw the exception | [Group-C/Q7.cpp](Group-C/Q7.cpp) | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6kr7ob0E0&list=PLlShVH4JA0otmMld-dvDBGxqqSNy1zlf3&index=5&pp=iAQB |
| 8 | Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file andopen it again as an input file and read the information from the file. |  |  |
| 9 | Write a function template selection Sort. Write a program that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array. |  |  |
|  | Gorup C |  |  |
| 10 | Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching with user defined records such as person record(Name, DOB, Telephone number), Item record (Item code, name, cost,quantity) using vector container |  |  |
| 11 | Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states, and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state name as an index, and returns the population of the state. |  |  |
